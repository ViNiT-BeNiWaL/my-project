This is a simple, single-page banking interface built using HTML and inline CSS. It displays a
starting balance of $0 at the center of the screen, along with two clearly labeled buttons:
Deposit (green) and Withdraw (red). The entire layout is centered using Flexbox, making it
responsive and visually balanced on all screen sizes. The design uses basic HTML tags like
<div>, <h1>, and <button>, and applies all styling directly within the style attribute

The use of inline CSS keeps things simple for small projects, though it's not ideal for larger
ones. Visual elements like padding, border-radius, and color coding help make the UI clean
and user-friendly. Overall, this layout demonstrates how a basic yet professional-looking
interface can be created using minimal code and no external files.
