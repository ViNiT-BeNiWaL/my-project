This HTML file creates a Student Registration Form using only basic HTML and HTML5 validation features.
The form includes the following input fields:
-> Name
    Input type: text
    User must enter their full name.
    The field is marked as required, so it must be filled before submission.

-> Email
    Input type: email
    Ensures the user enters a valid email address (like example@gmail.com).
    This field is also required.

-> Age
    Input type: number
    The age must be a number between 10 and 100.
    This is controlled using the min and max attributes.
    It is also marked as required.

At the bottom, there is a Register button to submit the form.
HTML5 validations automatically check that all fields are filled in correctly before allowing the form to be submitted.
